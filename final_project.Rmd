```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

# Univariate Plot Section
```{r : Load *.csv file.}
setwd('~/repos/nanodgreep3')
wdf <- read.csv('wineQualityReds.csv')
wdf <- wdf[,-1] # Get rid of unused column : 'X'
str(wdf)
summary(wdf)
```

## Quality
```{r}
qplot(wdf$quality) +
  xlab('quality')
```

It is better to convert qulaity variable to categorical variable, because its values are always integers. 

```{r}
wdf$quality <- factor(wdf$quality)
qplot(wdf$quality) +  xlab('quality')
```

```{r}
summary(wdf$quality)
```

Quality has 6 scores, from 3 to 6. Most of all have 5 or 6.
